# Data Cleaning
clean.py contains 3 python functions:
1. `removeNumbers()` - Removes the line numbers from an input file.
2. `shuffle()` - Shuffles the order of the questions in an input file. This was created to prove the order in which a question is read does not affect it's categorization.
3. `removeDuplicates()` - Removes all the duplicate questions in an input file.
