This file gives instructions for training and evaluating the EasyCCG parser.

SETUP
=====
Install Torch and Lua:
- Use the instructions here: http://torch.ch/
- Set up an enviornment variable pointing at the torch-lua executable: export TORCH=path/to/torch-lua

Set up some pre-trained word embeddings:
- Download some embeddings, e.g. Turian's: http://metaoptimize.s3.amazonaws.com/cw-embeddings-ACL2010/embeddings-scaled.EMBEDDING_SIZE=50.txt.gz
- Create a subfolder (e.g. 'turian'), and put the embeddings in the folder with the name embeddings.raw
- The training program expects that the first entry in the file should correspond to a rare-word embedding - check that this is the case.
- Pre-process the embeddings, with the command: ./splitEmbeddings.sh embeddings_folder

To get a dependency-based evaluation, you'll need some scripts from the C&C parser:
- Download the C&C parser
- Set up an environment variable pointing at the C&C folder: export CANDC=path/to/candc/
- Copy across some extra scripts, using: cp eval_scripts/* $CANDC/src/scripts/ccg/

Set up some training data:
- Make folders containing supertagged sentences in the format word|pos|category, in a file 
  called gold.stagged. POS will be ignored by the code, so can be empty.
- For evaluating the parser, you'll also need a gold.deps file containing test dependencies.  
- CCGBank test/training data in the correct format can be extracted from CCGBank using the 
  C&C parser's 'generate' program. Helpful notes on compiling/training the C&C are available 
  here: http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=Training_the_C%26C_Parser
- Steve Clark has released some very useful out-of-domain data for training/testing: 
  https://sites.google.com/site/stephenclark609/resources
- Matt Honnibal also has an excellent annotated Wikipedia corpus.
- By default, the parser uses a 'seenRules' file, which tell it which category combinations 
  have occured in CCGBank. This needs to be in the training data folder. Normally, you 
  can just copy this from this folder.
- If you've added new categories, the seenRules file needs to be updated, or 
  you can let the parser use any valid CCG combinations (using the "-s" flag). You may also 
  want to update the unaryRules file.


TRAINING AND EVALUATING
=======================
Training should then be straightforward, with a command like the following:
  ./do_training.sh my_model turian experiments/wsj_train/ experiments/wsj00/

This creates a model in the folder "turian/my_model", using embeddings from the "turian" folder, 
training data from "experiments/wsj_train/gold.stagged" and development data from
"experiments/wsj_dev/gold.stagged". All being well, it will output a labelled dependency
score on the development data.

To use lexical features (not recommended), add a file called 'frequentwords' to the training
folder before training, containing one word per line. These words will be used as additional
features. I found that this didn't help accuracy, and made things much slower.

To evaluate on test data, use something like:
  ./do_experiments.sh turian/my_model experiments/wsj23/ my_model

Evaluating on Biomedical text is a bit more work, because we need to convert to Stanford dependencies:
- Put the grs2sd-1.00 and markedup_sd-1.00 files in the same folder as gold.stagged
- You'll also need to put the gold-standard dependencies in that folder, in the file gold.deps
- Copy the script eval_test.py to that folder
- Use this script: ./do_experiments_genia.sh model_folder experiments/genia/ my_model
